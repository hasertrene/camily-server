Since my family and I sometimes struggle to plan activities without overlapping, I thought of making this children friendly family calendar.
The app allows each family member to plan their activities.

## The App

This project is a representation of the skills and knowledge I acquired by attending the Code Academy at Codaisseur.

The App is a SPA (single page application), with just a handful of Routes, as can be seen [here](https://github.com/renehasert/camily-client/blob/master/src/App.js)

## Technology

The website is set up with [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app).
The set up for the API and DB can be found in the Backend repo: [Camily-server](https://github.com/renehasert/camily-server)

The technologies I used are:
| Front end | Back end |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| React.js | PostgresQL |
| Redux | Express.js |
| Node.js | Sequelize/Sequelize-cli |
| Axios |
| Bootstrap |
| Date-fns |
| Sass |

## Goals for this project

The goal of this project is:

- to practice building a full-stack web app using the technologies that I acquired.
- showcase my development as a web developer
- practice solid git usage
